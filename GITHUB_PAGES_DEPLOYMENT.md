## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Large Files Warning
GitHub detected large video files in `public/` folder:
- `Blinding Lights.mp4` (59.19 MB)

**Recommendation:** For better performance, consider:
1. Using Git LFS for large files
2. Hosting videos on cloud storage (Google Drive, etc.)
3. Removing local videos and using only cloud links

### API Key Security
- OMDb API key is exposed in frontend code
- For production, consider setting up a backend proxy
- Current key: `8007f10a`

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to build
2. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/Pranayy1/Flix/actions
3. Verify settings at: https://github.com/Pranayy1/Flix/settings/pages

### If videos don't play:
- Local videos won't work on GitHub Pages (too large)
- Use Google Drive or cloud-hosted videos instead
- Update video URLs in `src/components/LocalMovies.jsx`

### If styles are broken:
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify base path in `vite.config.js`
